    <div class="content">
<p>Our cohort is a diverse group of institutions representing a variety of regions, institution types, and expertise (Fig. 1).</p>
<p>Estrella Mountain Community College (EMCC) is a 10,000-student Hispanic-serving institution near Phoenix AZ.</p>
<p>Houston City College (Houston City College (HCC)) is an 85,000-student Hispanic-serving institution in Houston, TX.</p>
<p>State University of New York, College at Geneseo (SUNY Geneseo) is a 4,000-student, primarily undergraduate institution near Rochester, NY.</p>
<p>State University of New York, Polytechnic Institute (SUNY Poly) is a 3,000-student technical institute in Utica, NY.</p>
<p>University of Wisconsin - La Crosse (UWL) is a 10,000-student large-masters institution in La Crosse, WI.</p>
<p>In preliminary discussions, we discovered a shared common vision of expanding workforce development in emerging technologies to better prepare our students for the rapidly changing demands of employers. We share regional connections (e.g., SUNY Geneseo and SUNY Poly), institutional similarities (e.g., EMCC and Houston City College (HCC), UWL and Geneseo) and technology foci (e.g. EMCC’s and SUNY Poly’s interest in advanced manufacturing; Houston City College (HCC) &amp; UWL’s interest in applied AI). We also discovered common objectives to increase our institutional capacities in emerging technologies, such as expanding external partnerships, strengthening internal infrastructure, and enhancing community and industry engagement. However, what brought our cohort together was a recognition that the diversity of the group was a distinctive and unique strength. Each institution within our cohort has complementary and unique strengths and resources that we will collectively leverage to enable, ensure, and promote project success for each institution. Indeed, ensuring diversity of expertise and flexibility among group members, has been identified as one of the key strategies for promoting successful partnerships and collaborations.1,2 The core objectives of expanding external partnerships, strengthening internal infrastructure, and enhancing community and industry engagement shared within a diverse group of experience and expertise bind our cohort together, provide multiple enabling partnerships that can be leveraged for maximum impact, and define the SPECIAL Consortium (Scaling Partnerships and External Collaborations through Industry-Aligned Learning).</p>
<p>Huenneke and co-authors identified eight strategies for building institutional research capacity at emerging research universities, including supporting planning grants and pilot projects, summer research conferences, affiliates programs, advisory committee member engagement, mentoring programs within and across institutions, investing in research infrastructure, investing in institutional leadership, and planning for leadership transition.3 We propose three general activities that build on these strategies and are responsive to the unique needs and contexts of our institutions:</p>
<p>Partnership management. Creating infrastructure for partnership sustainability, establishing new positions, or expanding existing institutional offices (investing in research infrastructure, planning for leadership transition)</p>
<p>Team Training. Establishing or expanding faculty externships, faculty fellows programs, or professional development programming (supporting pilot projects, mentoring programs within institutions, investing in leadership)</p>
<p>Collaboration events. Implementing advisory boards, hosting workshops, conferences, or showcase events to facilitate dialogue between institutions and partners (advisory committee member engagement, summer research conferences)</p>
<p>Because we are diverse institutions with different levels of maturity, needs, and goals within these areas, the specific details and formulations will vary from institution to institution. This diversity is our cohort’s strength. Each institution has identified its level of maturity (emerging, developing, or performing) in each area of expanding external partnerships, strengthening internal infrastructure, and enhancing community and industry engagement.4 For each area, there is at least one more developed institution that can offer guidance in navigating a path toward success for less developed institutions. Additionally, each institution has identified the resources and knowledge that they can offer other institutions. We explore these connections further in Section D. Leveraging our diverse knowledge and expertise, the SPECIAL Consortium will drive sustainable capacity-building and impactful outcomes in key technology sectors across five emerging research institutions representing over 100,000 students nationwide.</p></div>

    <div class="content">
<p>C1. Estrella Mountain Community College</p>
<p>C1.1 Current State &amp; Limitations. Estrella Mountain Community College (EMCC) is one of 10 independently accredited colleges within the Maricopa Community College County District (MCCCD), one of the largest community college systems in the U.S. MCCCD enrolled 86,523 students in spring 2024 and is the largest workforce training provider in Arizona. Maricopa County had the largest population growth of any county in the U.S. from 2021 to 2022.5 EMCC is a Hispanic-Serving Institution (58% of 8,549 students in spring 2024 identify as Hispanic). Additionally, 57.6% of students are first-generation students and 60.5% are female.</p>
<p>EMCC is positioned to lead workforce development efforts, both upskilling the current workforce and preparing the next generation of students. National trends highlight a growing demand for community college and workforce-aligned education. As recent data from the National Student Clearinghouse shows,6 while freshman enrollment is declining at four-year institutions serving low-income students, community colleges are seeing a slight increase (+1.2%) in first-year enrollment, along with growth in associate degree programs (+4.3%) and shorter-term credentials (+7.3%). This trend aligns with EMCC’s focus on developing sustainable, industry-centered programs, such as our Automated Industrial Technology certificates, designed in collaboration with industry professionals, and our expanding semiconductor bootcamp, which will soon offer a second-tier class. EMCC will use EPIIC funding to strengthen these initiatives and continue our commitment to creating lasting opportunities for students in high-demand fields.</p>
<p>EMCC has strong partnerships across sectors such as advanced manufacturing, energy, data centers, and education. A key partnership is with Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station, established through a Department of Labor grant, which has been instrumental in developing a pipeline of trained professionals. This partnership serves as a model for collaboration, involving joint efforts in faculty development, student programs, and equipment acquisition. EMCC has also expanded its outreach to include Western Maricopa Education Center (West-MEC) and local high schools to support dual enrollment and career pathways for high school students, while newer partnerships with Microsoft, TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company), and iMasons (collection of data center industry professionals) focus on addressing workforce needs in high-tech sectors like data centers and semiconductor manufacturing. However, newer partnerships with Ball, Red Bull, and Rauch are still in the early stages of development.</p>
<p>Despite these successes, several limitations hinder expansion of partnerships at EMCC. These include, but are not limited to:</p>
<p>Inconsistent communications with partners, particularly with newer companies like TSMC;</p>
<p>Lack of time and resources for faculty (especially in critical programs such as cybersecurity and automated industrial technology (AIT)) to build industry relationships;</p>
<p>Lack of administrative capacity to sustain multiple initiatives;</p>
<p>Skills gaps between EMCC faculty and industry needs; and</p>
<p>Infrastructure that is inadequate to support scaling partnerships, particularly in the advanced manufacturing, data center, and cybersecurity sectors.</p>
<p>C1.2 Institutional Capacity Building &amp; Partnership Expansion Goals. EMCC’s goal is to strengthen and expand workforce development by deepening industry-college partnerships. We propose the following objectives to achieve this goal:</p>
<p>Develop Educator-Industry Relationships: EMCC PI’s will implement strategies to reassign faculty time for building industry partnerships, starting with the cybersecurity and AIT programs, where the need is particularly urgent. EPIIC funds will be used to expand an existing Industry Immersion program (also known as an externship) that brings college faculty and high school educators together for a one- to two-day experience at a local company. Participants will gain firsthand exposure to day-to-day industry operations, engage in discussions with industry experts, and gain insights into emerging technologies, future job trends, and essential skills that can be directly integrated into coursework. This program will also foster long-term relationships with local industries, creating ongoing opportunities for real-world learning experiences.</p>
<p>In the future, EMCC will leverage these relationships to develop student internships and collaborative curriculum development, ensuring program alignment with industry standards. With additional coordination from industry partners, we will increase the number of participants and extend the program to other key industries or sectors such as semiconductors and AI, further enriching the educational experience and professional development for all involved.</p>
<p>Enhance Data Center Operations: Hire a part-time staff member in the EMCC Microsoft Data Center. This position will collaborate with iMasons for training, help faculty better understand data center equipment, and help create internships providing real-world experience under the guidance of industry experts.</p>
<p>Host and Attend Workforce Development Events: Host expos focused on advanced manufacturing, cybersecurity, and AI to connect students, faculty, and industry leaders, creating opportunities for networking and collaboration. These engagements will keep EMCC’s programs closely aligned with evolving workforce demands. Additionally, travel funds will support faculty attending workforce development events, ensuring they stay up to date with the latest trends.</p>
<p>Establish Advisory Boards: EMCC’s industry partner liaison will create advisory boards for the AIT and cybersecurity programs to guide partnership development, assess program outcomes, and align EMCC’s training with industry trends and requirements.</p>
<p>C1.3 Alignment with Institutional Mission. EMCC’s mission is to provide “transformative and inclusive learning experiences that foster lifelong learning. We strive to empower students to maximize their talents, improve their quality of life, and transform their communities.” Project objectives directly align with EMCC’s mission by offering immersive industry experiences (externships) for faculty and staff, equipping them with current knowledge needed to enhance student learning and success. Establishing and engaging with advisory boards will foster strong partnerships, ensuring programs remain relevant to workforce needs while creating valuable connections for students. Hosting workforce development events will bring together K-12, EMCC, and industry partners to promote collaboration and lifelong learning. These initiatives empower students to succeed in high-demand careers and drive meaningful change in their communities.</p>
<p>C1.4 Sustainability. EMCC will leverage resources, programs, and lessons learned from previous successful projects to sustain EPIIC-funded activities beyond the award period. Some activities might be sustained through partnerships developed or deepened with EPIIC funding (internship and experiential learning experiences, for example, could be funded by industry partners, or through research agreements facilitated using templates or models from our cohort partners). EMCC regularly funds initiatives that show growth and opportunities. We will seek college support for expos and other collaborative opportunities with industry partners. Additional grant funding (including, but not necessarily limited to, the GOALI and ATE programs at NSF, but also other agencies, state funders, and foundations) can be secured to support these existing initiatives or to develop new ones, continue refining and aligning our curriculum to respond to our industry partners’ evolving workforce needs</p>
<<h3>Table 1. Timeline of EMCC Goals and planned activities</h3>>
<p>C2. Houston City College</p>
<p>C2.1 Current State &amp; Limitations. In fall 2023, Houston City College (Houston City College (HCC)) became the first community college in the nation to offer a four-year bachelor’s program in Artificial Intelligence (AI). This presents many opportunities, but also several challenges, the most significant being the increasing competition at the national level for highly qualified AI faculty. The Digital &amp; Information Technology Center of Excellence (DIT COE) at Houston City College (HCC) has a track record of engaging with business and industry. Our partnerships are numerous, including: Nvidia, who donated computers and access to their Academy and unique opportunities in terms of certifications and tickets to events; Amazon Web Services (AWS) worked closely with Houston City College (HCC) before their official launch of the Machine Learning University program, providing curriculum through their academy and the provision of equipment such as robots; Microsoft chose Houston City College (HCC) as one of the first to pilot their AI Enablement Bootcamp for 27 faculty members and now recently scaled it to almost 200 faculty members from 87 institutions nationally as part of one of the first activities through the National Applied Artificial Intelligence Consortium (NAAIC) with Miami Dade Community College and Maricopa County Community Colleges; Intel provides ongoing support with curriculum and equipment for helping our students with the AI Global Impact festival competition; Apple donated computers to establish labs throughout Houston; Wolfram provides unlimited access to all of their products such as Mathematica, Wolfram Alpha Pro, and SystemModeler; Google donates 500 licenses a year to Grow with Google; and MaceVL built a state-of-the-art virtual reality lab. The DIT COE has established numerous partnerships with various industries; however, we must advance beyond these often transactional relationships. We propose the “Archimedes Initiative” to foster this advancement.</p>
<p>Currently, the critical factor preventing Houston City College (HCC)’s DIT COE from effectively engaging with business and industry is the lack of a dedicated staff member whose sole function is to develop and maintain meaningful, productive, and relevant relationships with new and existing industry partners. The lack of such a position means that potential industry partners engage with a random Houston City College (HCC) faculty member with whom they have a pre-existing relationship, indiscriminately, and without coordination. Consequently, it often happens that, despite a great deal of activity on the part of our faculty, no fruitful connections are made, no coordinated follow-up occurs, no long-term relationships are developed, and worst of all, opportunities are consistently missed for industry to meaningfully engage with the DIT COE. As a result, a plethora of potential resources go unrecognized, unrealized and untapped. The two most common questions posed by partner organizations are “How can we engage with the college in a way that takes full advantage of what our organization has to offer?” followed by “We don’t want this to be a one and done. How do we go about developing a long-term relationship?”</p>
<p>C2.2 Institutional Capacity Building &amp; Partnership Expansion Goals. AI is poised to have a transformative impact on the 21st century and beyond, just as the Industrial Revolution shaped the 18th century. According to Michael Bennet, “AI&#x27;s impact in the next five years? Human life will speed up, behaviors will change, and industries will be transformed -- and that&#x27;s what can be predicted with certainty.”7 Simultaneously, the rapid pace of technological advancement is not only redefining the concept of work but also how we will live, communicate, and engage with each other on a global scale.</p>
<p>Houston City Colleges is committed to providing “high-quality, affordable education that prepares students for both life and work in a global and technological society.”8 Preparing students to thrive in a technology-driven world requires a clear understanding of the current state of technology and its future trajectory. The DIT COE believes that the industries developing technology have the clearest vision for its future. This belief necessitates the creation of a new Ecosystem Manager position, responsible for implementing and overseeing the Archimedes Initiative (AI) on a daily basis. The Associate Dean of DIT COE will take the lead in hiring the Ecosystem Manager. The AI Ecosystem Manager will be responsible for fostering connections between businesses and industries, creating a network ecosystem, and to:</p>
<p>Identify, foster and build new industry partnerships. Engagement with partners will be quick and meaningful with an “ask” that is more refined as relationships are built and intertwined. The Ecosystem Manager will nurture a win-win that works best for both parties and stitches the needs of the program together. This activity will begin within 9 months and continue through the award period.</p>
<p>Provide regularly scheduled, meaningful industry engagement opportunities that serve the needs of all participants. This will ensure that industry partners are closely engaged with the faculty and staff to bring opportunities such as experiential learning, exposure to real-world problem-solving opportunities, internships and or apprenticeship opportunities, and regularly scheduled new employee recruitment initiatives. These relationships will ensure that the DIT COE closely aligns its educational programming with industry and nurtures opportunities for students and faculty such as workshops and curriculum development. This activity will be in place within 12 months and continue through the award period.</p>
<p>Schedule industry field trips and campus tours. Field trips will provide students and staff opportunities to experience a professional working environment at first-hand, and campus tours will enable industry to see and experience how the college operates. This activity will be in place within 12 months and continue through the award period.</p>
<p>Promote and leverage the entire menu of industry and college resources currently available. This will lead to student externships, student internships, real-world research opportunities, student patents, entrepreneurial opportunities, career placement opportunities, additional corporate scholarship opportunities, equipment and software donations and, most importantly, much needed new faculty recruitment opportunities. For example, over the next three years, the Eco System Manager will recruit twenty (20) additional AI faculty from seventy (70) new industry partners. This activity will be in place within 12 months and continue through the award period.</p>
<p>Make all industry connections personal! The single most important role the Ecosystem Manager will play is that of a conductor. The position will serve as the nexus for how the ecosystem of partners engage, operate, communicate, coordinate, and leverage all available resources. This level of coordination will foster strategic and meaningful engagement, fruitful connections, coordinated and timely follow-up, and most importantly productive connections that will consistently yield unimaginable and surprising results. This activity will begin as soon as the Ecosystem Manager is hired and continue through the award period.</p>
<p>C2.3 Alignment with Institutional Mission. Houston City College (HCC)’s vision is “to deliver relevant, high-quality education and training that ensures success for all students, the community, economy, and beyond.”8 The Archimedes Initiative aligns directly with the college&#x27;s overall vision and mission for the future by ensuring students work on real-world, industry driven issues using cutting edge technology. This combination ensures Houston City College (HCC) DIT COE graduates will quickly and seamlessly enter the workforce. The Archimedes Initiative actively supports the college&#x27;s vision and mission for the future by ensuring that our students receive a high-quality, cutting-edge, and relevant education. The instructors, who are also industry professionals designing AI for the future in real-time, provide students with access to this top-tier, real-world knowledge. As a result, Houston City College (HCC) students will be well-prepared to enter the workforce.</p>
<p>C2.4 Sustainability. To ensure the sustainability of this crucial initiative, the DIT COE will advocate for Houston City College (HCC) to include the costs of the Ecosystem Manager&#x27;s salary and benefits in its annual budget by the end of the award period. The impact of this position on student performance metrics will provide additional opportunities to secure the continuation of this initiative when grant funding ends.</p>
<p>C3. SUNY Geneseo</p>
<p>C3.1. Current State &amp; Limitations. Historically, Geneseo has primarily contributed to its regional technology ecosystem through preparing high-quality STEM graduate students. From 2019 to 2024, we graduated an average of 324 students/year in 14 STEM programs administered by five core departments. Approximately 35% of those alumni (Navg = 115/yr) obtained a graduate degree in a STEM field and we ranked in the top 1% of baccalaureate and master’s institutions (7 of 1152) in the number of alumni who earned PhDs in a STEM field.9 This pipeline of high-quality students has helped Geneseo establish a strong regional reputation among nearby R1 institutions and employers. Geneseo has had some success leveraging this reputation to establish externally funded research collaborations, such as DOE-funded collaborations in nuclear physics with the University of Rochester and in astrophysics with Cornell University. Co-PI Sheldon helped establish a 20-year partnership with American Rock Salt Company (the largest operating salt mine in the USA and largest employer in our county) that supports interns, tours for students and faculty of the underground mining operations, and an annual lecture series. However, these efforts have remained largely siloed, dependent on individual people and/or departments. There has been limited institution-level strategy to cross-fertilize, expand, and deepen these collaborations. We aim to address these institutional limitations through the EPIIC program.</p>
<p>One of the major challenges to expanding Geneseo’s participation in its regional technology ecosystems is that we have no external-facing office or person dedicated primarily to cultivating, facilitating, and supporting external partnerships. The Office of Sponsored Research is dedicated to grant development and management, but is primarily faculty-facing. The Career Design Office is dedicated to supporting internships and other experiential learning, but is primarily student-facing. A Project Director for Strategic Initiatives is split between Academic Affairs and the Finance and Administration Division of the College, but is primarily focused on expansion of academic programming. The Small Business Development Center provides services to new and struggling businesses, but does not seek to foster partnerships as the companies grow. There is limited institutional knowledge of both the needs of technology-focused industry partners and of the faculty expertise and capacity, and opportunities to foster greater collaboration between these two are often unrealized.</p>
<p>A secondary challenge concerns the cultural traditions and practices of Geneseo faculty related to workforce development and engagement with emerging technologies. As a liberal arts institution, Geneseo has not generally centered workforce development in the design of its educational experiences. Faculty lack knowledge of how their expertise might be applied to industry needs and have limited capacity to engage in such activities due to their teaching loads.</p>
<p>C3.2. Goals &amp; Strategic Plan for Institutional Capacity Building. The primary goal for Geneseo is to establish sustainable infrastructure dedicated to the cultivation and facilitation of mutually beneficial external partnerships that support meaningful educational experiences for Geneseo students and faculty, and that are responsive to the needs of technology-focused industry partners.</p>
<<h3>We have two primary objectives to meet these goals</h3>>
<p>Establish a Project ExPanD (External Partnership Development) Team within Geneseo’s Office of Strategic Initiatives dedicated to developing, cultivating, and sustaining external partnerships within our regional technology ecosystem.</p>
<p>Establish a Faculty Fellows Program dedicated to expanding and applying institutional expertise to collaborations and projects with external partners.</p>
<p>Project ExPanD</p>
<p>The Project ExPanD Team will have primary responsibility for all of the following activities:</p>
<p>identifying the expertise and capacity of Geneseo STEM faculty; understanding and communicating the technical needs of external partners;</p>
<p>establishing relationships with external partners that could support student internships, faculty externships, or research collaborations;</p>
<p>managing and implementing the Faculty Fellows program and other student internships, faculty externships, or research collaborations; and</p>
<p>implementing systems that would enable long-term sustainability of partnerships, for example through the implementation of software systems and training of Geneseo staff.</p>
<p>PI Peterson, professor of Chemistry and Biochemistry and Department Chair, will serve as the scientific liaison to the ExPanD team. He will be primarily responsible for items 1 and 2, and serving as the overall Project Executive Director. Co-PI Rider, Professor of Entrepreneurship and past President &amp; COO of Modern Marketing &amp; Commerce, will serve as the industry liaison to the ExPanD team. He will be primarily responsible for items 2 and 4. Dr. Santos-Smith, Geneseo’s Project Director for Strategic Initiatives, has knowledge and expertise with partner development and internal operations related to academic programming. She will be primarily responsible for items 2 and 3. Co-PI Sheldon, Interim Dean of the School of Arts &amp; Sciences, will serve in an active advisory role for the team, meeting regularly and guiding efforts at long-term institutional support and sustainability.</p>
<p>Table 2 outlines the anticipated activities, timeline, and metrics for success of the Project ExPanD team; adjustments to these criteria will be annually evaluated and implemented as needed. The ExPanD Project utilizes a shared responsibility model for the primary project goal, cultivating mutually beneficial external relationships, which will effectively leverage the diverse expertise among the team. As a proof of concept, we had a preliminary meeting with Meera Sampath, CEO of NSF’s Upstate New York Energy Storage Engine, and other Engine team members. Dr. Sampath expressed strong support for our effort and a discussion of preliminary collaboration opportunities (including potential faculty and student internships) is underway; a letter of collaboration is included as a supplementary document.</p>
<p>Faculty Fellows Program</p>
<p>Faculty fellows will be recruited from across the College to support and expand collaborations and projects with new external partners. Fellows would commit to (i) active participation in a shared activity with an external partner, and (ii) serving as ambassadors and advocates for these partnerships. Activities might include a faculty externship, mentoring of students engaged in an internship, or a collaborative research project. Specific details will be coordinated with the ExPanD Team. We also anticipate complementing the faculty fellow experiences with parallel student experiences, which will be supported without using EPIIC funds through existing college and/or partner mechanisms (e.g., an internship program).</p>
<p>Faculty Fellows will serve for one year and will be provided with a stipend to incentivize participation. We plan a tiered roll-out, with zero fellows in year one as partnerships are established and growing to 4-6 fellows in year 3. Table 2 outlines the anticipated activities, timeline, and metrics for success of Geneseo’s project objectives.</p>
<p>Table 2. Geneseo Timeline for Planned Activities and Deliverable Metrics for Success</p>
<p>C3.3 Alignment with Institutional Mission. The project activities align well with Geneseo’s broad mission and vision, as well as specific strategic goals. For example, one of the 2022–27 Strategic Plan focus areas is student success, aiming to “Enhance and expand learning, creation, and inquiry by developing new academic and co-curricular programs and restructuring and/or expanding existing ones to provide an honors experience for all learners. All opportunities should… highlight experiential and integrative learning; and build upon our academic and community strengths” (emphasis added).10 Another focus area is outcomes, aiming to “integrate career education into the academic experience for 100% of first-year students, and ensure all students will experience at least one high-impact career mobility practice prior to graduation.” (emphasis added). More generally, Geneseo’s mission and vision center on its identity as the honors college within the SUNY system that “inspires students to develop their knowledge and skills to build a better world” and “is exceptional in cultivating creativity, engagement, and discovery.” The partnerships, student opportunities, and high-impact experiences we anticipate will result from the capacity-building activities of this proposal clearly help achieve these goals.</p>
<p>C3.4. Sustainability. The proposed activities will be housed in Geneseo’s Office of Strategic Initiatives (OSI), which currently supports two full-time positions (a director and a manager), and provides an effective mechanism to ensure long-term sustainability of the institutional capacity. Dr. Santos-Smith, the Director of Strategic Initiatives, is designated as senior personnel on the project and will ensure the activities and knowledge generated from the project are integrated into OSI activities to ensure operational logistics are smoothly continued after the granting period. Planned implementation of partner relationship management software will ensure that relationship knowledge and history are permanently retained at the institution level, rather than the individual level. Finally, we will seek long-term support through additional NSF programs that support these and related activities, such as Experiential Learning for Emerging and Novel Technologies (ExLENT) and Grant Opportunities for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) proposals.</p>
<p>We anticipate the faculty fellows program will be self-sustaining because the long-established culture of our faculty is to optimize opportunities to advance research and internship opportunities for students. Our STEM faculty are productive researchers who routinely mentor and publish with undergraduate students and the externship experiences will provide new opportunities to do so. Funding to continue to provide course releases to the faculty will be established through strategic external partnerships, as we have already done with American Rock Salt, Inc.</p>
<p>C4. SUNY Poly</p>
<p>C4.1. Current State &amp; Limitations. Fueled by major investments from New York State and academic programs that align extremely well with the Mohawk Valley’s emerging innovation economy, SUNY Poly is actively growing its portfolio of institutional partnerships. Currently, these partnerships are facilitated by the college’s external-facing units—e.g., Government Relations, Research, Continuing and Professional Education, and Career Services. Faculty members also engage with potential partners, including colleagues at other colleges and former students who are now working for local employers. SUNY Poly also recently established new consortia that include key industry stakeholders from the public, private, and nonprofit sectors. These efforts have led to a number of valuable outcomes, including recruiting fairs that bring local employers to campus and other on-campus events that connect industry stakeholders with SUNY Poly leadership. While these outcomes have benefited SUNY Poly in the immediate term, their impact on longer-term partnership-building efforts has been limited for three reasons.</p>
<p>First, SUNY Poly lacks physical spaces that are located near its target audience of potential partners—i.e., regional employers and industry stakeholders that represent the Mohawk Valley’s most cutting-edge and innovative industries, including information technology, advanced manufacturing, and health sciences. In many instances, these employers and stakeholders have expressed an interest in partnerships that involve more in-person collaboration, including employee trainings and workforce development programs. But given the rather isolated location of SUNY Poly’s campus, and the current state of certain of our key facilities, it is not practical to develop such in-person collaborations at this time. While major infrastructure improvements are planned, it will take time to develop adequate spaces that can house these activities. In the meantime, the leasing of temporary off-campus satellite sites in strategic locations across the Mohawk Valley region would greatly enhance SUNY Poly’s partnership-building efforts.</p>
<p>Secondly, SUNY Poly’s partnership-building activities are hindered by the college’s outdated and fragmented approach to cultivating relationships. As real-time conversations occur between SUNY Poly team members and new or existing industry stakeholders, there is no effective mechanism to share this information across the institutional ecosystem in an organized and easily accessible way. Current tools used by several functional areas within SUNY Poly are not a practical solution to this challenge. These tools are meant to collect and share very specific sets of unrelated information—e.g., admissions data, fundraising data. Absent a formal tool that is exclusively devoted to industry partnerships—e.g., a customer relationship management (CRM) system—a highly coordinated approach to cultivating relationships, sharing information, and establishing longer-term industry partnerships at scale will never materialize.</p>
<p>Lastly, given that SUNY Poly is a small institution (just under 3,000 students) that is regionally focused, it has a limited presence in networks that include much larger colleges that tend to be more nationally focused. Enhanced involvement in these types of multi-university consortiums would improve SUNY Poly’s access to nationwide funding programs and industry engagement opportunities.</p>
<p>C4.2. Goals and Strategic Plans for Institutional Capacity Building. We will use EPIIC funding to address the above-mentioned limitations and challenges in the following ways.</p>
<p>A small network of pilot SUNY Poly satellite sites will be developed and launched across the multi-county Mohawk Valley region. These sites will be located in close proximity to clusters of industry partners, creating new engagement opportunities that would not be possible at SUNY Poly’s main campus. In addition to housing activities that support partnership-building activities—e.g., faculty-led and industry-aligned learning workshops, laboratories for student-focused experiential learning—these satellite sites will help SUNY Poly establish a much stronger presence across the region by connecting faculty and staff with industry stakeholders in key geographic areas that are outside of campus.</p>
<p>In year one, SUNY Poly will launch its first satellite site within Griffiss Business and Technology Park, which is 15 miles from SUNY Poly’s primary campus. Anchored by the Air Force Research Laboratory, Griffiss is home to 70+ firms across various emerging industries, including IoT, quantum information science, cybersecurity, 5G networks, and unmanned aircraft systems. It is also home to the Griffiss Institute, a technology accelerator for the Department of Defense that leases space to local and regional partners, making it the ideal location to house our initial satellite site. This site will become a hub of partnership-building activities involving faculty from SUNY Poly’s College of Engineering and industry stakeholders across the Griffiss ecosystem. After the successful launch of this initial site, EPIIC funding will support the development and launch of further sites in the city of Utica and nearby Herkimer County. With growing clusters of employers that span advanced fulfillment center operations, advanced manufacturing, and health sciences, Utica and Herkimer are ideal locations for SUNY Poly satellite sites. The locations of these sites are still being determined, but they will connect SUNY Poly faculty and staff with civic and industry partners in both municipalities, accelerating the creation of industry-aligned workforce development and experiential learning programs for local adults. Upon receiving EPIIC funding, SUNY Poly will conduct an analysis of available spaces at the Griffiss Institute and within the City of Utica and Herkimer County. Once appropriate sites are identified, SUNY Poly will lease/rent these spaces. Concurrently, SUNY Poly will work closely with each respective cohort of nearby industry partners to develop partnership-enhancing initiatives. SUNY Poly will also develop a marketing campaign to promote upcoming satellite site activities (e.g., industry symposiums, workforce development events, experiential learning workshops).</p>
<p>EPIIC funding will also be used to cover the cost of purchasing a new customer relationship management (CRM) system that will be solely devoted to industry partnerships. All faculty and staff that engage in partnership-building activities will have access to this new CRM, and comprehensive trainings will be conducted to ensure effective implementation and utilization. This new tool will greatly enhance SUNY Poly’s ability to collect and share information related to industry partnerships. This new and highly coordinated approach will enable SUNY Poly to cultivate relationships, share information, and establishing longer-term industry partnerships at scale.</p>
<p>Lastly, SUNY Poly will use EPIIC funding to cover membership fees for national industry-university consortia. In year one, SUNY Poly will seek to become a core member of the U.S. National Semiconductor Technology Center (NSTC), a public-private consortium that connects academic institutions with semiconductor companies, governments, workforce organizations, and other related stakeholders to increase collaboration and strengthen the U.S. semiconductor industry. NSTC membership aligns extremely well with the semiconductor processing-to-packaging research, education, and training center forthcoming at SUNY Poly, which will be in the same on-campus facility currently occupied by Semikron Danfoss, a global technology leader in power electronics. This center will become a hub of semiconductor-focused collaborative activities that span workforce development, experiential education, and cutting-edge research. SUNY Poly is partnering with Semikron Danfoss on the development and launch of this center, making it an ideal time for SUNY Poly to become a core member of NSTC. Core membership will provide SUNY Poly with a range of partnership-enhancing benefits, including opportunities to connect with NSTC’s nationwide network of core members and exclusive participation in technology- and semiconductor-focused communities of interest. In years two and three, SUNY Poly will pursue memberships in similar nationwide consortia focused on emerging technologies and innovation economies.</p>
<p>C4.3. Alignment with Institutional Mission. This initiative aligns seamlessly with our institutional mission and strategic plan, which aims to establish key strategic alliances that will position the Mohawk Valley region as a premier destination for workforce development, education, research, and entrepreneurship.</p>
<p>C4.4. Sustainability. EPIIC funding will provide initial funding for all of these activities, but additional funding sources will be pursued in order to ensure long-term sustainability. As each satellite site grows, fee-based programs and activities will be developed, providing a consistent funding stream for each site. SUNY Poly will also pursue other appropriate grants, including NSF’s Experiential Learning in Emerging and Novel Technologies program (ExLENT) and NSTC funding opportunities only open to NSTC core members.</p>
<p>C5. University of Wisconsin - La Crosse</p>
<p>C5.1. Current State &amp; Limitations. Partnerships between the University of Wisconsin - La Crosse (UWL) and other IHEs are typically pursued by individual departments and are academically motivated. Partnerships with major employers and regional businesses are developed and maintained either through personal connections or with the assistance of the Director of Community Engagement (DCE). The DCE works in the Chancellor’s Office and serves many roles including, but not limited to, liaison between the university and the community and oversight of UWL Community Idea Exchange. The UWL Community Idea Exchange is a community relationship manager (CRM) database designed to help community groups and UWL faculty and staff find collaborative community-engaged learning and research projects for either a classroom of students or a faculty member&#x27;s personal research. Community partners can post project ideas by following the submission process provided on the website. The DCE then determines which projects should be posted in the exchange and which projects should not be posted. Projects are typically not posted if the DCE deems the project too challenging to match with a faculty member. Such an example would be a local non-profit that builds and rehabs homes but does not track the economic impact of their work. This non-profit can post a request, tagging specific departments that may be able to participate, asking for help in better understanding the economic impact of their work. A limitation with this method is that only a 3-4 sentence description is provided about the project. Another limitation is that the DCE will only solicit specific faculty who have asked for community engaged projects despite better connections with different faculty.</p>
<p>There is no university-wide policy or training for individuals to follow in seeking partnerships. When the university has brought community partners and faculty together to explore potential partnerships, the faculty have been unable to engage in conversations that move partnerships forward, because they are not aware of the resources available to them and the types of partnerships that can be created.</p>
<p>There are faculty whose area of expertise connects naturally to community partnerships and who leverage their training to bring partnerships to UWL. However, the university does not have a consistent method for documenting, assessing, or maintaining these partnerships. Often, existing partnerships are not maintained after someone leaves or changes roles at UWL - at least in part because the university is unaware of the details of the partnerships. This makes it challenging (if not impossible) for another person to step in and continue where the previous person left off.</p>
<p>C5.2. Goals and Strategic Plans for Institutional Capacity Building. UWL has three capacity-building goals:</p>
<p>Expand External Partnerships: Organizations within the region are interested in partnering with IHEs, yet UWL has not been able to capitalize on this interest due to a lack of interest in the previous administration. By expanding external partners, UWL creates a network which serves its students, faculty &amp; staff as well as the local community. Partnerships allow for the university to connect with people and ideas that it may not have had access to.</p>
<p>Strengthen Internal Infrastructure: UWL has a fragmented infrastructure to support community engagement and there is no central location where this information can be found. Assessing current infrastructure and creating a centralized location is critical to sustained partnership development. UWL values the role that individuals play in the development of partnerships, but also recognizes that the partnership belongs to the university and not an individual. A centralized infrastructure will increase efficiency of connecting the university with new and existing community partners.</p>
<p>Enhance Community and Industry Engagement: For partnerships to be successful, the experience and process of engaging with UWL must be enhanced beyond just the UWL Idea Exchange portal for both the university and for the community. Faculty will begin to see how community engagement can open new opportunities for their students. The community will also recognize that the new administration welcomes and encourages community partnerships.</p>
<p>These goals will be accomplished by three objectives (Table 3):</p>
<p>Team Training. We will use EPIIC funding to provide the Director of Community Engagement 3 faculty fellows per year. The role of these fellows is two-fold. First, they will provide additional support to an over-extended person so that each idea that comes to and from the university can receive adequate attention. Second, they will work with the director in breaking down the barriers that exist between the different cultures in the workforce and in academia. Award funds will also be used to train faculty how to engage with community partners. This training will provide best-practices of community engagement and allow faculty to understand what reasonable expectations are.</p>
<p>Partnership Management. The co-PIs will assess policies and practices within the university for community partnerships, including evaluation of training, documentation, follow-through of current and past partnerships. The co-PIs will use this assessment to develop a university-wide policy aimed towards sustainability of relationships so that when a person transitions in or out of the university, there is adequate documentation for another person to continue and build upon the partnership.</p>
<p>Collaboration Events. EPIIC funds will be used to create an event each year that brings together the community and university to discuss collaboration. The first event will assess the needs of regional employers in emerging technology such as applied AI. The information gained from these events will be used to assess the abilities of the university to meet these community partner needs. The third event will bring both the university and community together to begin forming collaborations focused on emerging technologies, such as applied AI.</p>
<p>Table 3: UWL Timeline for Planned Activities and Deliverable Metrics for Success</p>
<p>C5.3. Alignment with Institutional Mission. The current UWL strategic plan consists of four pillars which focus on students, community and employees. These pillars are increasing community engagement, investing in our people, advancing transformational education, and achieving excellence through equity and diversity. Our project goals are aimed directly towards the UWL strategic plan pillar of increasing community engagement. The project objectives, team training and collaboration events, are examples of the strategic plan pillar “investing in our people”. The project objective, partnership management, is an example of the strategic plan pillar of “advancing transformational education”.</p>
<p>C5.4. Sustainability. The proposed activities will be housed in UWL’s Provost Office and Community Engagement Office. Provost Morgan is a co-PI and Lisa Klein, the Director of Community Engagement, is a key collaborator. The faculty fellows will work closely with the Office of Community Engagement to develop infrastructure for long-term sustainability. In addition, the proposed update to our current Community Relationship Manager software will aid in the sustainability of this proposal so that relationship knowledge and history are permanently retained at the institution level, rather than the individual level.</p></div>

    <summary><span class="badge-dot" style="box-shadow:none; width:8px; height:8px"></span>Collaborative Plans</summary>
    <div class="content">
<p>This project brings together five distinct institutions that differ in structure, geographic location, and resources, to work together in a collaborative partnership that is greater than the sum of its individual parts. The cohort shares a common set of goals of expanding external partnerships, strengthening internal infrastructure, and enhancing community and industry engagement. All five participating institutions are currently engaging in these activities to varying degrees (Fig. 2), consistent with the expected the maturation of emerging research institutions.4 However, the cohort is also bound together by the fact that each participating institution has a need for something that one or more of the others can provide for it. As two examples, Houston City College (HCC) has extensive industry partnerships that they plan to leverage for recruitment of AI-focused faculty, coupled with a need for training new faculty who may not have extensive teaching experience; SUNY Geneseo and UWL have less developed external partnerships, but extensive expertise in undergraduate education. EMCC has a highly successful engagement program with local energy technology partners and seeks to extend this model to other technology sectors; SUNY Poly has a robust, diverse, and active technology portfolio and seeks to expand its engagement and outreach activities. Each partner institution benefits from the complementary skills, experience, and knowledge of more successful and seasoned partner institutions, thereby maximizing the efficacy of efforts at each individual institution, as well as the overall, shared impact.</p>
<p>In furtherance of our goals of mutual support and effective communication, we will engage in the following collaborative activities.</p>
<p>Quarterly Virtual Cohort Meetings. These meetings allow exchanges of information, documents, best practices, challenges and successes, between participating institutions to the mutual benefit of all of them.</p>
<p>Annual In-person Cohort Meetings. These meetings, held before or after the annual PI meeting or a convenient conference, will provide an opportunity for more in-depth engagement between institutions and their teams, and to plan future projects each year.</p>
<p>Ad Hoc Working Groups. We will convene ad hoc virtual working groups whenever there is a need to discuss matters arising outside of, and needing resolution before, any of the regularly scheduled meetings.</p>
<p>Shared Real-time Resource Platform. We will identify, develop, or purchase a suitable platform where all cohort institutions can share instruments, documents, lessons learned, data or other resources.</p>
<p>These four activities enable real-time sharing of “the good, the bad, and the ugly” among partner institutions. This ongoing dialogue of critical lessons learned at the institutional level serves as the catalyst for meaningful collaboration.</p></div>

    <summary><span class="badge-dot" style="box-shadow:none; width:8px; height:8px"></span>E. Assessment And Evaluation</summary>
    <div class="content">
<p>As requested by EPIIC program staff, assessment will occur at the institution-level based on the needs and plans of each cohort member (detailed below). In general, evaluations will use mixed method analyses with quantitative and qualitative data to assess progress towards reaching the goals of expanding external partnerships, strengthening internal infrastructure, and enhancing community and industry engagement. Formative assessment will be conducted throughout the award period, using data to guide program refinement. Data sources will include implementation materials (such as meeting minutes, participant lists, affiliations), and program data provided to the external evaluator to track metrics described in the institutional plans. Evaluation and program refinement efforts will be supported by regular videoconference meetings between program leadership and the evaluator to review project updates and discuss findings from data collection activities. Each year, the evaluator will produce a formative report summarizing project successes and challenges, tracking performance metrics, and providing recommendations for improvement. At the end of the award, a cumulative summative report will describe the project outcomes, overall impact, effective strategies, and lessons learned. Additional data sources may be integrated into the evaluation as necessary to provide a robust analysis.</p>
<p>Evaluators at each institution are detailed below, along with any unique assessment plans that address institution-specific needs. Institutions will share results of their assessments with other cohort members at planned annual meetings (see Section D), and work collaboratively to identify best practices and successful strategies to achieve shared objectives.</p>
<p>EMCC. Ashley Burkart will serve as EMCC’s evaluator. An experienced NSF reviewer and a college biology instructor, she brings expertise in scientific content, curriculum development, and workforce pathways. Her work on initiatives like the Teacher Researcher program and STEM outreach demonstrates a strong commitment to diversity, equity, and broader societal impacts, enabling her to provide thorough evaluations aligned with NSF project criteria.</p>
<p>Houston City College (HCC). Dr. Joanna Kile (Ellijay, GA) will serve as Houston City College (HCC)’s evaluator.</p>
<p>Geneseo &amp; Poly. Kelley Madden, Director of Evaluations of Brockport Research Institute (BRI, Brockport, NY) will serve as the evaluator for both Geneseo and Poly. BRI has conducted over 60 external evaluations, primarily focused on STEM education and requiring partnerships between higher education and industry, including NSF S-STEM, Noyce, ATE, and CIVIC grants. In addition to activities described above, partner, faculty fellow, and student intern perspectives will be gathered through annual interviews, to gauge the EPIIC initiative’s impact on SUNY Geneseo integration into the regional technology ecosystem.</p>
<p>UWL. Patrick Barlow, University Assessment Coordinator of University of Wisconsin - La Crosse, will serve as the evaluator for UWL. Dr. Barlow has served as University Assessment Coordinator at UWL for 14 years. His areas of expertise are learning outcomes assessment, positive psychology, test/survey construction and analysis, and program evaluation.</p></div>

    <div class="content">
<p>Consistent with the strategy detailed in Equity and Excellence: A Vision to Transform and Enhance the U.S. STEMM Ecosystem (2022),11 this project advances knowledge and practice of how emerging research institutions can effectively engage in and enhance key technology sectors to promote economic growth and opportunity, global STEM competitiveness and national security. Key metrics will include number of external partners, number of collaborative projects, number of participants, number of events, and participant survey feedback. A review of funded EPIIC proposals suggests previous cohorts have typically formed around common regions, institution types, or technology focus. The SPECIAL cohort’s emphasis on institutional diversity offers a distinctive opportunity to explore new or additional models for achieving these goals.</p></div>
